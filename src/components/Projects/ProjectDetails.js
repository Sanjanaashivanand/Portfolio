    title: 'Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch', 
    description: 'The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a fundamental architecture in neural networks. This project aims to construct an MLP from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The objective is to understand the foundational concepts behind neural networks by implementing a basic feedforward neural network with multiple layers.'
